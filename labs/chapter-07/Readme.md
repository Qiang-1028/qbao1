# ITMD-521 IT-D 872 Chapter-07 Lab

You will copy this template file to your own private GitHub repo provided.  Under your itmd-521 folder you will create a sub-folder named: **labs**.  Under that folder create a sub-folder named: **chapter-07**.  In that folder place this Readme.md

## Objectives

- Demonstrate creating dataframe from various file formats
- Demonstrate the advantages of "BigData" data types vs. conventional text based types
- Demonstrate the the application of compression and its advantages in dealing with large files

### Lab

**Note:** include this line at the bottom of your .bashrc in the virtual machine: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HADOOP_HOME/lib/native` -- this is needed to enable Spark to use native compression libraries.
